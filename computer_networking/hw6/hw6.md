## Hands-On Exercises
(1) Read first the “dig” manual of BIND9 (including the later versions), especially the
“+trace” and “+recursive” options, and answer the following questions.
(a) A query generated by dig is by default a recursive query (so that a local name 
server continues the query on behave of the client). Why is it used by dig (or resolver 
routines in other applications)? Also issue a recursive query to www.ucla.edu, and 
explain each RR in all five sections of the reply.
(b) Describe each consulted name servers in an iterative query for www.ucla.edu 
using dig.  

**[ans]**  
> (a) When use recursive query mode between `Client` and `Local name server`, `Local name server` 
will cache query result in its dataset; Without that, only `Client` will know the answer.
And `Local name server` will use iterative query mode between others NS.

`TTL` means that how many time to update. (e.g. if change mapping ip address NS 
need `TTL` times to update)  

> (b) Local name server -> (.) root-servers.net.  
     Local name server -> (edu.) edu-servers.net.  
     Local name server -> (ucla.edu.) dns.ucla.edu.
